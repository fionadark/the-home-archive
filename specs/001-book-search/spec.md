## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Book Search (Priority: P1)

A user wants to quickly find a specific book in their home library by typing a search query and seeing the most relevant results first.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value - users can find their books faster than manually browsing through their collection.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a search term in the search interface and verifying relevant books appear in order of relevance, delivering the core value of book discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has books in their library, **When** they enter a book title in the search box, **Then** books with matching titles appear first in results
2. **Given** the user has books by various authors, **When** they search for an author's name, **Then** books by that author appear in the results ordered by relevance
3. **Given** the user searches for a partial word, **When** they enter "harr" (partial of "Harry"), **Then** books with titles or authors containing "Harry" appear in results

### User Story 2 - Advanced Field Search (Priority: P2)

A user wants to search across different book fields (genre, ISBN, publisher, etc.) to find books based on various criteria.

**Why this priority**: Extends the basic search to cover all book metadata, enabling more sophisticated discovery patterns for users with large collections.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by searching for genre names, ISBN numbers, or publisher names and verifying appropriate books are returned with proper relevance ranking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** books have genre information, **When** user searches for a genre like "mystery", **Then** books in that genre appear in results
2. **Given** books have ISBN data, **When** user searches for an ISBN, **Then** the exact book with that ISBN appears first
3. **Given** books have publisher information, **When** user searches for publisher name, **Then** books from that publisher appear in results

### User Story 3 - Multi-word and Complex Search (Priority: P3)

A user wants to search using multiple words or complex queries to find books that match multiple criteria.

**Why this priority**: Handles advanced use cases for power users who need sophisticated search capabilities to manage large collections.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering multi-word queries and verifying that books matching multiple terms rank higher than those matching single terms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** books in the library, **When** user searches for "science fiction", **Then** books matching both "science" AND "fiction" rank higher than books matching only one term
2. **Given** books with various metadata, **When** user searches for "stephen king horror", **Then** horror books by Stephen King rank highest in results
3. **Given** a search returns many results, **When** user enters more specific terms, **Then** results become more focused and relevant

### Edge Cases

- What happens when search returns no results (empty library or no matches)? → Display "No results found" message to user
- How does system handle special characters or symbols in search queries? → Strip/ignore special characters from search queries
- What happens when search terms match multiple fields with equal relevance? → Use alphabetical order by title as tiebreaker
- How does system handle very long search queries (100+ characters)? → System caps search input at maximum 100 characters
