# Feature Specification: Dark Academia Library Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-web-application-this`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "web-application This project should be able to launch as a sleek, clearly organized, \"dark academia aesthetic\" inspired website. There should be a login page where the user can log in to see their personal archive, which other users should not be able to see. There should also be a page for the user to see the books already in their personal library, and search/sort them by any of the data categories (title, author, physicalLocation, etc). On this page, the user should be able to add/remove the location tags and delete books from their library if they wish. There also should be a page for the user to search books such that the website accesses the H2 database (which will eventually be an actual database) so that they can add new books to their library."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-21

- Q: How should users create accounts to access the application? → A: Self-registration with email verification (users create their own accounts)
- Q: What level of dark academia visual design should the interface use? → A: Rich academic elements (elaborate typography, library motifs, vintage textures, warm lighting effects)
- Q: How should the book database be managed for user additions? → A: Existing database with user additions (users can add from database OR create new book entries)
- Q: How should user sessions be managed for security? → A: Remember me option (users choose between session types at login)
- Q: How should books be displayed in the library interface? → A: Card-based grid with list view option (visual cards as default, switchable to table view)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Secure Personal Library Access (Priority: P1)

A library owner wants to access their personal book collection through a secure, aesthetically pleasing web interface without other users being able to view their private collection.

**Why this priority**: This is the core security and privacy foundation - users must be able to securely access their personal library before any other functionality becomes valuable. Without this, the application cannot protect user data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an account, logging in, and verifying that only the authenticated user can see their library data, delivering the fundamental value of private book collection management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the website, **When** they navigate to the login page, **Then** they see a dark academia themed login interface
2. **Given** a user enters valid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to their personal library dashboard
3. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** another user tries to access the first user's library URL directly, **Then** they are denied access and redirected to login
4. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they try to access any library pages, **Then** they are redirected to the login page

### User Story 2 - Personal Library Management (Priority: P2)

A library owner wants to view, organize, and manage their existing book collection through an intuitive interface that allows searching, sorting, editing locations, and removing books.

**Why this priority**: This enables users to actively manage their existing collection, providing immediate value for organizing and maintaining their library. It builds upon the authentication foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, viewing the library page, and performing search/sort/edit/delete operations on existing books, delivering core library management value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they access their library page, **Then** they see all their books displayed in a clean, organized interface
2. **Given** books are displayed, **When** the user searches by any field (title, author, physicalLocation), **Then** the results are filtered accordingly
3. **Given** books are displayed, **When** the user sorts by any column, **Then** the books are reordered appropriately
4. **Given** a user selects a book, **When** they edit the physical location, **Then** the change is saved and reflected immediately
5. **Given** a user selects a book, **When** they choose to delete it, **Then** they are prompted for confirmation and the book is removed upon confirmation

### User Story 3 - Book Discovery and Addition (Priority: P3)

A library owner wants to search for new books in the database and add selected books to their personal collection to expand their library.

**Why this priority**: This extends the library's value by enabling growth and discovery of new books. While valuable, users can still manage their existing collection effectively without this feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the book search page, searching the database, and adding selected books to the personal library, delivering collection expansion capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they access the book search page, **Then** they can search the entire book database
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** the user selects a book not in their collection, **Then** they can add it to their personal library
3. **Given** a book is added to their collection, **When** the user returns to their library page, **Then** the new book appears in their personal collection
4. **Given** a user searches for books, **When** results include books already in their library, **Then** those books are clearly marked as already owned

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's session expires while managing their library? → Redirect to login with appropriate message
- How does the system handle search queries that return no results? → Display "No results found" message with search suggestions
- What happens when a user tries to add a book that's already in their collection? → Show "Already in library" message and prevent duplicate addition
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during book operations? → Show appropriate error messages and allow retry
- What happens when the database is temporarily unavailable? → Display maintenance message and graceful degradation
