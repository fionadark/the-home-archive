# Tasks: Dark Academia Library Web Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-web-application-this/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD approach required by constitution - tests included for all user stories

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Backend follows Spring Boot Gradle structure: `src/main/java/com/thehomearchive/library/`
- Frontend structure: `frontend/src/js/`, `frontend/src/css/`, `frontend/src/html/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 authentication but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 auth and US2 library but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)
- Entities before repositories
- Repositories before services  
- Services before controllers
- Backend before frontend integration
- Core implementation before UI polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Entities within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Frontend styling tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with backend development
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD requirement):
Task: "Contract test for user registration endpoint"
Task: "Contract test for login endpoint"  
Task: "Contract test for email verification endpoint"
Task: "Integration test for authentication flow"
Task: "Security test for unauthorized access protection"
Task: "Frontend test for login form"

# Launch all entities for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create User entity"
Task: "Create EmailVerification entity"
Task: "Create UserSession entity"
Task: "Create UserRole enum"
Task: "Create VerificationType enum"

# Launch parallel frontend styling:
Task: "Style login page with dark academia theme"
Task: "Style registration page"
Task: "Style dashboard page"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Tasks T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Tasks T008-T016) - CRITICAL foundation
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Tasks T017-T048)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently - complete auth flow
5. Deploy/demo MVP - users can securely register, verify email, login, access dashboard

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP - secure access!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP + library management!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full feature set!)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Tasks T001-T016)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication & Security)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Library Management)  
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Book Discovery)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 114 tasks
- **User Story 1 Tasks**: 32 tasks (T020-T051) - Authentication & Security
- **User Story 2 Tasks**: 27 tasks (T052-T078) - Library Management  
- **User Story 3 Tasks**: 29 tasks (T079-T104) - Book Discovery & External APIs
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 49 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has comprehensive test coverage and can be validated independently
- **Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (secure authentication and dashboard access)

---

## Constitution Compliance

‚úÖ **TDD Approach**: All user stories include comprehensive tests written first
‚úÖ **Spring Boot 3.x**: All backend tasks use Spring Boot 3.2+ with Java 21+ LTS
‚úÖ **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Clear separation of controller ‚Üí service ‚Üí repository layers
‚úÖ **Spring Security**: JWT authentication with proper security configuration
‚úÖ **JPA/Hibernate**: All entities use proper JPA annotations and relationships
‚úÖ **RESTful APIs**: All endpoints follow REST conventions per OpenAPI specification
‚úÖ **Performance**: Tasks include monitoring, caching, and performance considerations
