# The Home Archive üìö

A home library management application built as an experiment in **AI-driven software development** using [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and **Claude Sonnet 4**.

## About This Project

This application demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development by creating a complete book search and management system entirely through collaborative development between a human developer and AI implementation. 

### Development Approach
- **AI-Driven Development**: Built collaboratively with Claude Sonnet 4
- **Specification-First**: Designed using GitHub Spec Kit methodology
- **Iterative Refinement**: Features evolved through natural language conversations
- **Quality-Focused**: Comprehensive testing and code optimization throughout

## Features

### Intelligent Book Search
- **Multi-field search** across title, author, genre, ISBN, publisher, and metadata
- **Fuzzy matching** and partial word support (e.g., "harr" finds "Harry Potter")
- **Relevance-based ranking** with smart result ordering
- **Physical location filtering** to find books by room/shelf location
- **Real-time search** with sub-200ms response times

### Library Management
- Complete book metadata tracking (title, author, genre, ISBN, publication year, etc.)
- Physical location management with predefined room categories
- Reading status tracking and personal ratings
- Comprehensive book information display

## Tech Stack

The technology stack was selected through AI analysis of requirements, considering factors like:
- **Java 21 LTS**: Modern language features with long-term support
- **Spring Boot 3.x**: Mature ecosystem with excellent AI code generation support, used with Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, and Spring Security
- **Gradle**: Flexible build system with dependency management
- **H2/MySQL**: Development flexibility with production scalability
- **OpenAPI**: Self-documenting API with interactive exploration
